# The Effectiveness of Tax Increment Financing (TIFs) in Ameliorating Blight and Promoting Economic Development for The City of Chicago

## Introduction

#### What is Tax Increment Financing?

According to the webpage for the City of Chicago: <https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/tax_increment_financingprogram.html>

*"Tax Increment Financing is a special funding tool used by the City of Chicago to promote public and private investment across the city. Funds are used to build and repair roads and infrastructure, clean polluted land and put vacant properties back to productive use, usually in conjunction with private development projects. Funds are generated by growth in the Equalized Assessed Valuation (EAV) of properties within a designated district over a period of 23 years."*

**Overall Objective:** To help local companies expand and create employment opportunities for Chicago residents. To allocate tax revenue to blighted areas in an effort to ameliorate economic and community decay.

**Purpose of TIFs:**

Tax Increment Financing is a special funding tool that is directed towards areas of diminished economic value and quality of life. Municipalities perform studies to determine if an area is eligble for a TIF if it is considered blighted or in danger of becoming blighted. If a TIF is determined as necessary a development project is created and a TIF budget is allocated to the region. TIFs have been a practice in Chicago since the 1970's. Usually, those who live outside of the TIF region pay more inExcessive Vacancies taxes that support the TIF budget. Much of the budget goes towards plan development, surveys, engineering, acquiring land, environmental clean up, demolition, infrastucture improvemnets, job training, building construction, consulting fees, etc. When a TIF ends, remaining money is then given back to the county.

**Controversy around TIFs:**

There are several reasons why many consider TIFs to be controversial. Many believe that the term "blighted" is applied too loosely ,such as in the case of extending TIF funding to wealthier areas. TIFs also are subject to scrutiny in light of the fact that their funds are kept separate from other municipal revenue. Many also criticize TIFs for allowing corporate eligibility.

**Success of TIFs**

The question of whether or not tax revenue increasing is a successful operation is often found to be ambiguous. In this project I will attempt to see if TIFs have generated economic development and reduced "blight".

**What is Blight?**

The city of Chicago as of 2022 has a few principle indicators of blight:

-   "**Dilapidation:** An advanced state of disrepair or neglect; critical defects in primary structural components, building systems and secondary structural components"

-   "**Obsolescence:** A building or improvement which is in the process of falling into disuse or has become ill suited for the original use"

-   "**Deterioration:** Physical deficiencies or disrepair in buildings or site improvements that are beyond normal maintenance; major defects in the doors, win- dows, porches, gutters and downspouts, fascia and in primary areas like foundations, frames, roofs; surface cracking, crumbling, potholes, depressions, loose paving material, weeds pro- truding through surface."

-   "**Structures below Minimum Code Standards:** Structures that do not meet the standards of zoning, subdivision, building, fire, and other governmental codes applicable to the property."

-   "**Illegal Use of Individual Structures:** Uses in violation of the applicable federal, state, or local laws."

-   "**Excessive Vacancies:** The presence of buildings that are unoccupied or under-utilized and that represent an adverse influence on the area because of the frequency, extent, or duration of the vacancies."

-   "**Lack of Ventilation, Light or Sanitary Facilities:** Inadequate natural light or ventilation in rooms without windows or improper window sizes; Inadequate sanitary facilities such as garbage storage, bathroom facilities, hot water, etc."

-   "**Inadequate Utilities:** Underground and overhead utilities that are of insufficient capacity, deteriorated, antiquated, obsolete, or in disrepair, or lacking."

-   "**Excessive Land Coverage & Overcrowding:** Over-intensive use of property and the crowding of buildings and accessory facilities on a site."

-   "**Deleterious Land Use or Layout:** Incompatible land-use relationships, inappro- priate mixed uses inside buildings, environ- mentally unsuitable uses, offensive uses, etc."

-   "**Environmental Clean-up:** A need for the clean-up of hazardous waste, hazardous substances, or underground storage tanks required by State or federal law, provided that the remediation costs constitute a material impediment to the development or redevelop- ment of the redevelopment project area"

-   "**Lack of Community Planning:** Absence of the guidance of a community plan or where such a plan has not been followed, resulting in adverse or incompatible land-use relationships, inadequate street layout, im- proper subdivision, parcels of inadequate shape and size to meet contemporary development standards, or other evidence demonstrating an absence of effective community planning."

-   "**Lack of Growth in Equalized Assessed Valuation (EAV):** The total EAV for the study area has either de- clined or is increasing at an annual rate that is less than that of the balance of the municipality for three of the last five calendar years"

For a region to be considered "blighted" it must satisfy at least 5 of these indicator.

**What Are The Goals of A Redevelopment Plan:**

-   "**Studies, Surveys, Development of Plans and Specifications, Implementation and Administration of the Redevelopment Plan:** Costs may include staff and professional services for architectural, engineering, development advisors and managers, legal, marketing, financial, planning or other services, and related hard and soft costs."

-   "**Property Assembly:** Costs may include acquisition of land and other property, real or personal, or rights or interest therein, demolition of buildings, clearing and grading of land, and other site preparation costs"

-   "**Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, Repair or Remodeling**"

-   "**Construction of Public Works or Improvements**"

-   "**Job Training and Retraining Projects:** Costs may include welfare-to-work initiatives."

-   "**Financing:** Costs may include necessary and incidental expenses related to the issuance of obligations, including interest accruing during the estimated period of construction of any redevelopment project for which such obligations are issued and for not exceeding 36 months thereafter and including reasonable reserves related thereto"

-   "**All or a Portion of a Taxing District's Capital Costs:** Costs resulting from the redevelopment project necessarily incurred or to be incurred within a taxing district in furtherance of the objectives of the redevelopment plan and project, to the extent the municipality by written agreement accepts and approves such costs."

-   "**Relocation Activities**"

-   "**Payment in Lieu of Taxes**"

-   "**Interest Costs:** Costs may include expenses incurred by a developer or other user related to the construction, renovation or rehabilitation of a redevelopment project, generally up to 30 percent of interest, but up to 75 percent of interest costs incurred for rehabilitated or new housing units for low- and very low-income households"

-   "**Costs of the Construction of Low-Income Housing:** TIF revenues may be used to pay up to 50 percent of the cost of construction of new housing units to be occupied by low- and very low income families."

-   "**Day Care**"

While the scope of TIFs is far to large to fully understand at a complex level, this project aims to see if a small subset of the **redevelopment goals** have been reached. It also aims to see if a subset of the conditions of **blight** have been ameliorated.

**Research Question:**“Do TIFs in Chicago ameliorate blight and promote economic development?”

#### Blight Indicators

**Vacant Buildings / Properties**

<https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests-Vacant-and-Abandoned-Building/d9re-tmpw>

"Data set contains all 311 calls for open and vacant buildings reported to the City of Chicago since January 1, 2010. The information is updated daily with the previous day's calls added to the records. The data set provides the date of the 311 service request and the unique Service Request \# attached to each request. For each request, the following information (as reported by the 311 caller) is available: address location of building; whether building is vacant or occupied; whether the building is open or boarded; entry point if building is open; whether non-residents are occupying or using the building, if the building appears dangerous or hazardous and if the building is vacant due to a fire."

**(Incredibly Large) Building Code Violations / Orders – may not be usable**

<https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Violations/22u3-xenr/about_data>

"Violations issued by the Department of Buildings from 2006 to the present. Lenders and title companies, please note: These data are historical in nature and should not be relied upon for real estate transactions. For transactional purposes such as closings, please consult the title commitment for outstanding enforcement actions in the Circuit Court of Cook County or the Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings. Violations are always associated to an inspection and there can be multiple violation records to one inspection record. The information presented on this website is informational only and does not necessarily reflect the current condition of the building or property. The dataset contains cases where a respondent has been found to be liable as well as cases where the respondent has been found to be not liable."

#### Development Indicators

**Affordable Housing Developments**

<https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Affordable-Rental-Housing-Developments/s6ha-ppgi/about_data>

"The rental housing developments listed below are among the thousands of affordable units that are supported by City of Chicago programs to maintain affordability in local neighborhoods. The list is updated periodically when construction is completed for new projects or when the compliance period for older projects expire, typically after 30 years. The list is provided as a courtesy to the public. It does not include every City-assisted affordable housing unit that may be available for rent, nor does it include the hundreds of thousands of naturally occurring affordable housing units located throughout Chicago without City subsidies."

**Day Care Availability** *(Updated 2025)*

"data related to child care, early childhood education"

#### Both Blight and Development Indicators

**Equalized Assessed Valuation (EAV) growth (This data set is very large)**

Assessed Valuation Dataset (Proxy Dataset for EAV):

<https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Assessed-Values/uzyt-m557/about_data>

"Land, building, and total assessed values for all Cook County parcels, from 1999 to present. The Assessor's Office uses these values for reporting, evaluating assessment performance over time, and research.\
When working with Parcel Index Numbers (PINs) make sure to zero-pad them to 14 digits. Some datasets may lose leading zeros for PINs when downloaded.\
\
This data is parcel-level. Each row contains the assessed values for a single PIN for a single year. Important notes:

-   Assessed values are available in three stages: 1) mailed, these are the initial values estimated by the Assessor's Office and mailed to taxpayers. 2) certified, these are values after the Assessor's Office closes appeals. 3) Board of Review certified, these are values after the Board of Review closes appeals.

-   The values in this data are assessed values, NOT market values. Assessed values must be adjusted by their [level of assessment](https://prodassets.cookcountyassessor.com/s3fs-public/form_documents/classcode.pdf) to arrive at market value. Note that levels of assessment have changed throughout the time period covered by this data set."

**Business openings/closings**

Business closings: <https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/BusinessClosed/ytxg-j8ei/about_data>

"Business licenses issued by the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection in the City of Chicago from 2006 to the present. This dataset contains a large number of records/rows of data and may not be viewed in full in Microsoft Excel. Therefore, when downloading the file, select CSV from the Export menu. Open the file in an ASCII text editor, such as Notepad or Wordpad, to view and search. " (CONTAINS CANCELLATION DATE OF BUSINESS LICENSES)

Business openings: <https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/New-Business/dksa-3swg/about_data>

(CONTAINS A LIST OF NEW DISTRIBUTED BUSINESS LICENSES)

**Business Owners (Potential Alternative to business licenses data set) — doesn't contain community number**

<https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Business-Owners/ezma-pppn/about_data>

This dataset contains the owner information for all the accounts listed in the Business License Dataset, and is sorted by Account Number. To identify the owner of a business, you will need the account number or legal name, which may be obtained from theBusiness Licenses dataset: <https://data.cityofchicago.org/dataset/Business-Licenses/r5kz-chrr>. Data Owner: Business Affairs & Consumer Protection. Time Period: 2002 to present. Frequency: Data is updated daily.

### Data Preparation

The city of Chicago is divided into 77 different community areas with a unique ID number. We need to be able to divide the city into districts on order to know where different data points, vacant buildings, grocery stores, etc. are occurring. We will do this by indexing the community areas by "AREA_NUMBE"(area number) and "COMMUNITY"(community name). The Idea is to determine how many TIFs a particular community has at a particular time and determine as time increases whether or not particular markers get better worse or remain the same.



```{r}
# Install data cleaning packages
install.packages(c("janitor", "dplyr"))
install.packages("readxl") 
```

```{r}
library(janitor); library(dplyr)

# Read in the csv file
community_areas <- read.csv("data/Boundaries_-_Community_Areas_20251111.csv")
# Only keep the fields community "COMMUNITY" and "AREA_NUMBE"
community_area_index <- community_areas |>
                          clean_names() |>
                          select(area_num_1, community)
```



Now we will process the data set for "TIF Projects" data set so that we can determine which communities receive TIF funding, how much funding they receive, when the TIF project started/ended, and

  dplyr::mutate(rolling_tif_balance = cumsum(total_tif_dollars), rolling_tif_count =  cumsum(n_tifs)) |>
  dplyr::ungroup() |>
  dplyr::arrange(year, community_area)

# Split into a list of data frames (one per year), now with zeros where appropriate
TIF_yearly_list <- split(TIF_by_year, TIF_by_year$year)

View(TIF_yearly_list)
View(TIF_yearly_list[["1993"]])
View(TIF_yearly_list[["2022"]])

```

```{r}
# Load CSV file of all vacant buildings in Chicago
vacant_buildings_original <- read.csv("data/311_Service_Requests_-_Vacant_and_Abandoned_Buildings_Reported_-_Historical_20251111.csv")

TIF_projects <- vacant_buildings_original |>
  select(-SERVICE.REQUEST.TYPE, -SERVICE.REQUEST.NUMBER, -DATE.SER)

View(vacant_buildings)

# We will similarly 
```

```{r}
# Load CSV file of all affordable rent housing in Chicago
affordable_rent_housing <- read.csv("data/Affordable_Rental_Housing_Developments_20251111.csv")

```

```{r}
library(readxl)
# Read xl 
daycares_chicago <- read_excel("data/Child-Care-Data-by-CCA-June-2024.xlsx")
View(daycare_data)

```{r}


```

```{r}
# Used for Cook County, this will require more serious data cleaning.
assessor_proxy <- read.csv() # Large, determine if usable later

```

```{r}
